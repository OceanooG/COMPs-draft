# Comp-proposal-Tutorial-Report

This Repo includes the Comps proposal by haotian wang
This Repo also includes a Tutorial report and the software documentation for the tutorial. 

This is a tutorial project follows [this tutorial](http://ai.berkeley.edu/reinforcement.html).

In this project you will be implementing the value iteration and Q-learning. You will test the agents first on Gridworld, then apply them to a simulated robot controller and Pacman. 

This project includes an autograder for you to grade your solutions on your machine. This can be run on all questions with the command:

`python autograder.py`

It can be run for one particular question, such as q2, by:

`python autograder.py -q q2`

It can be run for one particular test by commands of the form:

`python autograder.py -t test_cases/q2/1-bridge-grid`

See the autograder tutorial in Project 0 for more information about using the autograd

More command to test out this project is included in the tutorial link. 

Th only three file you should edit in this project is `valueIterationAgen.py`, `qlearningAgents.py`, and `analysis.py`. The rest part of the project is already done and finished. 

Again this project is practice attempt and a report on [this tutorial](http://ai.berkeley.edu/reinforcement.html)
